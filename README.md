Vectors R Programming

The simplest and most common data structure in R is the vector. Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a list may contain multiple data types.

Atomic vectors include logical, character, integer, and complex. Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for 'not available').These values are generated as the result of logical 'conditions'.
